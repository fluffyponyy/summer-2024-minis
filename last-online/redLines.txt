kinda annoyed with you rn
that book was really expensive
i got it in japan
oh you didn't know that?
hmm
well still
i'd really like it if i could get it back
huh

i don't get you
what did you think was going to happen
that i was gonna confess to you?
no way
you actually thought
that's pretty funny man

you are happy, right?
oh thats nice to hear, at least
i'd really feel like a failure otherwise

sorry lol
i'll make sure to send you lots of pictures
by the way, have you listened to any radiohead lately?
what do you mean you don't know what radiohead is?
i thought you loved radiohead
i'm honestly getting a little confused haha

i promise you won't be alone forever
as long as you can get a little better at returning books on time lol
oh yea?
um...
i don't have any interest in you, sorry
i thought you knew that...
